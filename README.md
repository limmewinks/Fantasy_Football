# Fantasy_Football
Attached is analysis of my fantasy football league.  

I took this from espn by copy/pasting as match destination formatting to remove html formatting. After that, I cleaned the data in excel with various nested if statements to format all data in an ingestible format for jupyter notebook. 

I bucket the analysis by seperating Matchups, league, Teams, and players into sections. 

Within Jupyter notebook, I used the python3 kernel and libraries within python such as Pandas, NUmpy, Matplotlib, and seaborn.

Attached are .ipynb files from each time I reran the report. Additional attachments include the cleaned datasets ((FF master list) + (Standings)) pulled from excel in .csv format.
